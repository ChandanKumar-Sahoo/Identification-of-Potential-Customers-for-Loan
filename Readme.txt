Predicting the likelihood of a liability customer buying a personal loans.

1. The data has been collected from a Bank to predict the libility of customers for buying a loan.
2. It has total 14 number of feature columns and one target column, which is to be predicted.
3. Basic EDA has been carried out and the distribution of each column has been explored through visualization.
4. After spliting the data into train and test set, various supervised machine learning techniques were used to predict the target column.
5. Supervised classification techniques such as Logistic Regression, NB, KNN, SVM were used for predicting the target classes.
6. To validate the performance of the models, Confusion Matrix were visualized along with the accuracy and f1-scores.
7. Based on the feedback from point 6, models were reevaluated through Minmax Scalar and VIF.
8. Best model has been selected based on the point 6 and 7 for deployment.
